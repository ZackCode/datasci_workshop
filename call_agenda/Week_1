# Call Agenda for Week 1 June26 - July1

In this first call conference, I hope to talk about:

1. My background, what I think is my strength and weakness for this course
2. What I hope to achieve by the end of this course, both skill-wise and career-wise, and my planned timeline for this course
3. My ideas and questions for my capstone project
4. Goal for next week

I also hope to know more about my mentor during this conference.

I look forward to talking with you.
