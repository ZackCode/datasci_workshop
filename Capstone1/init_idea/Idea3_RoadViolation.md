# Idea 3: Road Violation investigations
## Introduction
Weather conditions can have an important factor on road violations. For example, snow makes vechicle slipy, making an accident or a violation easier to occur. However, it would be interesting to know how large does this weather impact have on traffic violation/accident, and if vechilcle type has any impact on accident rate or fatal rate. 
## Data set
The data set comes from data.gov, they are:
1. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/traffic-violations-56dda, traffic violation record in Montgomery county, from 2012 to current time.
2. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/severe-weather-data-inventory-swdi, NOAA record on severe weather such as hail
3. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/ncdc-storm-events-database NOAA record on storm data
4. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/daily-weather-records NOAA daily weather record
5. https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/population-estimates US goverment population record
## Goal
1. Summary traffic violation based on violation type, vehicle type, and its driver, based on population estimation and violation record
2. Try to build a model to predict its possibility having several types of traffic violation, based on the vechile type, the driver, and weather conditions
## Question
The goal itself seems not so clear at this moment.
