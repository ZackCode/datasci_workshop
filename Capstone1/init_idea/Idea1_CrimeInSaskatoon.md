# Idea1: Crime Analysis and Prediction
## Introduction
Saskatoon is among the most dangerous cities in Canada. According to Candian police annual report, Saskatoon has a top-3 crime severity index from 2009 to 2013. However, not all parts of the city are dangerous. Anyone who lives here for a reasonably long time would know that western part of the city is far safer than eastern part. However, it would still be interesting to see the safety levels for local communities and find out the potential reasons accountable for such safety levels.   
## Datasets available
http://www.communityview.ca/Catalogue/ResourceList/Browse/2
1. 25 types of criminal records for 169 local communities from 2004 to 2015,
2. population record for 169 local communities from 2004 to 2015, with age, gender, etc.
3. Other types of data such as employment, income, household, but these data are limited to 1 to 6 years.
## Goal
Given data sets on crime, population from 2003 to 2015,
1. Conduct a summary of crime data for communities
2. Try to identify the factors leading to high crime rate for most common crime types.
## Questions
The record is only consistent with criminal record and population. For other records, some years are missing
