    "This project comes from the kaggle competition \"Data Science Bowl 2017\". This year's topic is lung cancer detection. The goal defined by the competition is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. \"\n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, in this capstone project I would like to accomplish the following objects:\n",
    "1.A model that will detect lung cancer.\n",
    "2.Compare the performance versus other submissions."

    "\"This will dramatically reduce the false positive rate that plagues the current detection technology, get patients earlier access to life-saving interventions, and give radiologists more time to spend with their patients.\""
