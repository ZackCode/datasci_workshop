# datasci_workshop

This repository contains my notes and support documents for the data science career tack course from Springboard.com. It also serves as an index (and a showcase) for my capstone projects, my mini-projects for data science career track course on Springboard.com mainly, and on other courses or projects.

## Capstone Projects

A capstone project is a relatively large project where multiple aspects of data science are employed, including data wrangling, inferential statistics, and machine learning.

### Capstone Project 1 (In progress):

This project comes from a Kaggle competition. Walmart wants to know the correlation between weather condition and its sales record. More specifically, Walmart wants a model that can "accurately predict the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products (like umbrellas, bread, and milk) around the time of major weather events at 45 of their retail locations".

To this end, in this capstone project, I would like to accomplish the following objects: 1.A model that will predict product sales in major weather events 2.Evaluate how the weather condition affect the sales

### Capstone Project 2 (In progress):

This project comes from the Kaggle competition "Data Science Bowl 2017". This year's topic is lung cancer detection. The goal defined by the competition is:

"Using a data set of thousands of high-resolution lung scans provided by the National Cancer Institute, participants will develop algorithms that accurately determine when lesions in the lungs are cancerous. "

To this end, in this capstone project, I would like to accomplish the following objects: 1.A model that will detect lung cancer. 2.Compare the performance versus other submissions.
