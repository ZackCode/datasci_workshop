    "## The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "This project comes from a kaggle competition. Walmart wants to know the correlation between weather condition and its sales record. More specifically, Walmart wants a model that can \"accurately predict the sales of 111 potentially weather-sensitive products (like umbrellas, bread, and milk) around the time of major weather events at 45 of their retail locations\". \n",
    "\n",
    "To this end, in this capstone project I would like to accomplish the following objects:\n",
    "1.A model that will predict product sales in major weather events\n",
    "2.Evaluate how the weather condition affect the sales"

    "1.It will help Walmart better manage its inventory, and keep its customers out of rain\n",
    "2.It will help Walmart better evaluate the effectiveness of its current management against weather event"
